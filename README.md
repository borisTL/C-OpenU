  <p>The Systems Programming Lab  is the fundamental applied course in the computer science curriculum, providing students with the essential practical knowledge required throughout their studies.</p>

  <p>The lab focuses on the following areas:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Thorough understanding of the C language and the principles of structured programming: Learning and applying universal programming principles, such as abstraction, proper use of data structures, building code with simplicity, utilizing libraries, writing library functions, documentation, modularization, information hiding, and writing machine-independent code.</li>
    <li>Familiarity with the structure of the Unix operating system: The C language is closely related to the Unix system. The lab is conducted on the Linux operating system, which is a member of the Unix family, and a version of it is installed on the personal computer. By the end of the lab, learners reach a level of proficiency as a user of the system. The exercises ensure familiarity with system calls.</li>
